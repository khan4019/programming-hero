                                In this modern world, the technologies have shifted drastically! Some languages and
                                technologies have seen downfall over the period of time, whereas some of them have
                                broken the bars! Python is one of those languages that is at its peek and does not seem
                                to stop in this race in the near future. Python is that rabbit, that is fast and
                                furious. “Slow and steady”- is not the principle that one follows in this ever changing
                                modern world. While Java still stands tall, Python and Java seem to be the hottest
                                trends and technologies in the current market. I am going to give you 10 reasons why you
                                should ditch Java right away and learn Python!

                                Before starting let me take you to a quick revision of Python and Java are :
                            </p>

                            <h2>What is Python?</h2>

                                In 2020, surely I don’t need to tell you what Python is, right? <br>

                                Python is a simple, open-source, interpreted, object-oriented and high level programming
                                language.

                            <p>
                                Java is like that topper of your school that always gives you a tough fight. <br>

                                Java is an object-oriented, platform independent programming language with a huge use
                                case in the enterprise world.

                                Let’s give you 10 reasons to start with Python today and ditch Java. If your heart is
                                biased towards Java, then my dear friend, let me tell you, It will be tough for you to
                                know these reasons.

                                When it comes to programming, the next thing that comes to our mind is our stress
                                reliever and problem solver, Stack Overflow. When we compare Java and Python on the
                                stack overflow trends, it shows that Python is more active and used in the community
                                based on the interactivity.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Reason 2 : Less number of lines</h2>

                            <p>
                                As a programmer, one thing that comes to our mind is the number of lines of code that we
                                have to write. Some people might call us lazy, but we become extremely happy when our
                                purpose is served with lesser lines of code. <br>

                                Let us take a simple example of the legendary “Hello World” program.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                <code>

                                Pheww! That’s a lot of work to print a simple Hello World.5 lines of code! Why would one
                                want to do that…
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <u>Python Code:</u>
                            </p>

                            <pre>
                                <code>
                                    print(“Hello World”)
                                </code>

                            <p>
                                And we are done! Just one line of code to get the work done. <br>

                                Thus, let it be any kind of problem or a program, your mate Python will make sure that
                                you write less lines of code.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Reason 3 : Dynamically Typed</h2>

                            <p>
                                Yes, Python is dynamically typed. What does that mean? <br>

                                It means you don’t need to determine variable types as the checks are done at runtime by
                                the interpreter. Thus, this makes Python more “English like” language and in return
                                ensures more code readability and simplicity. <br>

                                Whereas Java has strict syntax being statically-typed, one needs to declare variables
                                explicitly. This makes things complicated for the developers and especially the
                                beginners.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Reason 4 : Indentation and No Semicolons!</h2>

                            <p>
                                If you have worked on Java, you cannot forget the days when you write a very complex
                                code and compile it. You are excited for the output and what you get is an ERROR! And
                                most probably this error is “Missing semicolon” or “A missing bracket”.
                                <br> <br>

                                Yes, in Java every line of code is terminated with a semicolon and blocks of codes are
                                created using curly braces({}). And this sometimes kicks your head and your programs
                                with Errors.
                                <br>
                                Here, you mate Python comes into action. No semicolon! Yes, you read it right. Python
                                does not have a concept of a semicolon. Block of codes are important, and Python takes
                                care of that as well. It uses indentation rather than curly braces.
                                <br> <br>

                                Moral of the story : Less symbols, more code readability.

                            <h2>Reason 5 : Ease of Learning</h2>

                            <p>
                                Now that you have seen good enough reasons, the question might arise in your mind :
                                Which one is easier to learn? <br>

                                Java or Python. It's like choosing between Top 2 restaurants to eat in your city. <br>

                                Both are object oriented, But at the same time you as a beginner want to get comfortable
                                in this computer science field. And Python can do that for you! Choosing Java as a
                                beginner can turn into a nightmare if you don’t get a proper tutor. Whereas Python is a
                                beginner friendly language with a very easy learning curve. <br>

                                Python provides a more English like feel that can make anyone comfortable and learn
                                programming. It’s syntax, code readability, lesser lines of code, etc are add on
                                features that make Python an easy to learn language. It takes a load off coders by
                                taking care of a lot of the language’s complexity. While Java still holds the power and
                                has its benefits and it can do wonders for experienced coders, Python can be a perfect
                                choice for beginners and give you more enjoyable coding experience
                                <br> <br>

                                So what’s stopping you from getting your hands on Python?

                            <h2>Reason 6 : Object Oriented but also a scripting language</h2>

                            <p>
                                Yes, Python supports Object oriented paradigm like many other languages out there.But it
                                offers something more : The power of scripting! <br>

                                What is a scripting language? <br>

                                In simple terms, a scripting language is a language that allows you to write scripts!
                                <br>

                                Rather it be over the web or some automation or some hacking stuff that you are already
                                excited about!
                                <br>
                                So with Python it's like, asking for one thing and getting a bonus treat with it.
                                <br>
                                Whereas Java is a strict Object oriented programming language.
                                <br>
                                What would you go for? An ice cream with a single flavour or an ice cream with some
                                flavors and added choco chips? I would surely go with the other one!

                            <p>
                                Python is slower and Java is Faster, you might have heard that, But my question to you
                                is, Is it? <br>

                                It’s not your fault that you think Python is slower, it's the talks in the community
                                that brought these things in your ears. <br>

                                I don’t disagree that it isn’t slow, but can it affect you? <br>

                                Let me give you a simple example: A code with a time complexity of Big O(n^2), will have
                                the same complexity in Java and in Python as well. What my point is, If Python was that
                                much slow, then could it get the popularity and the acceptance by the community? Well
                                that has answered the question. <br>

                                Thus, Python might be slower than some other languages, but it won’t affect you! <br>

                                It’s a myth.

                                Let me make this one short, the range of applications is directly proportional to job
                                opportunities. We already saw the range of applications, Python has. Thus there is no
                                doubt that it provides an ocean of job opportunities. While Java, being a rigid
                                language, the job profiles and opportunities compared to Python are pretty less. Rather
                                it be a job for fresher or an experienced developer, Python has got you back to fetch
                                you with a good respectable Job!
                            </p>

                            <h2>Reason 10 : The Money Maker</h2>

                            <p>
                                Ofcourse, this point is something you can’t skip. Because you gotta pay your girlfriends
                                bill, right? Jokes apart, but Python is something that you can call as a money maker.
                                Rather it be a Job or any freelance role, it is surely gonna fill your pockets.
                                <br>
                                Python offers an average salary of $110,000 and it is not a number that you would like
                                to ignore. Salary for freshers is also way higher than that of a Java fresher. <br>

                                You decide, who’s gonna pay you bills? Python or Java
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Thus to conclude, I would like to say Python is the language of the future and you
                                should put your hands on it right away. Hope this didn’t hurt any Java Developers
                                sentiment, I just wanted to make a point that it's the perfect time to ditch Java and
                                start learning Python today.
                            </p>
