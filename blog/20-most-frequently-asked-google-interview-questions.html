                                Getting a job at Google is a dream of many. We all are aware of the perks that you get
                                as a Google employee, and that excites us. But before that, there is something that we
                                need to clear, and we are afraid of, “The Google Interviews”. Here are some most
                                frequently asked Google interview questions that might help you get an idea of the
                                Google interviews.

                            <h2>1) Tell me everything you know about hash tables.</h2>

                            <p>
                                Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group
                                of similar objects. In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash
                                functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called the hash table. The
                                idea of hashing is to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array.
                                Each element is assigned a key (converted key). By using that key you can access the
                                element in O(1) time. Using the key, the algorithm (hash function) computes an index
                                that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.
                            </p>

                            <h2>2) Imagine you were creating a search engine for events; how would you go about it?</h2>

                            <p>
                                The browser could select a location and then look for an event by a category (music,
                                networking, food, art, etc.) and/or event type (conference, etc). The user can also
                                initiate a keyword-based search. The engine should be capable of a keyword initiated
                                search and apply any filter (category, event type, etc.) on top of that. A search should
                                bring back a list of results, having key information about the events, name, location,
                                ticket information, etc. The location when hovered over should show a map.

                            <h2>3) Can you count the strings that can be formed using a, b, and c under given
                                constraints?</h2>

                            <p>
                                Given a length n, count the number of strings of length n that can be made using ‘a’,
                                ‘b’ and ‘c’ with at-most one ‘b’ and two ‘c’s allowed. <br>
                                A simple solution is to recursively count all possible combinations of string that can
                                be mode up to the letter ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.

                            <p>
                                Given a Binary Tree, check whether the Binary tree contains a duplicate sub-tree of size
                                2 or more. <br>
                                An Efficient solution based on tree serialization and hashing. The idea is to serialize
                                subtrees as strings and store the strings in the hash table. Once we find a serialized
                                tree (which is not a leaf) already existing in a hash-table, we return true.

                            <p>
                                A Simple Approach is to find all the substrings of a given string. For every string,
                                check if it is a valid string or not. If valid and length is more than maximum length so
                                far, then update maximum length. We can check whether a substring is valid or not in
                                linear time using a stack. The time complexity of this solution is O(n2)

                                We start with a function for getting the largest value. The largest value is simply the
                                "rightmost" one, so we can get it in one walk down the tree by traversing rightward
                                until we don't have the right child anymore. <br>
                                With this in mind, we can also find the second largest in one walk down the tree.

                                Our first thought might be to build our reversed list "from the beginning," starting

                                the tail of the input list. To get to that node we'll have to walk through the whole
                                list once( O(n) time). And that's just to get started. That seems inefficient.

Like Prim’s MST, we generate an SPT (shortest path tree) with a given source as root. We maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in the shortest-path tree, another set includes vertices not yet included in the shortest-path tree. At every step of the algorithm, we find a vertex that is in the other set (set of not yet included) and has a minimum distance from the source.

                                Max Non-Negative SubArray. Given an array of integers, A of length N, find out the maximum sum sub-array of non-negative numbers from A. The sub-array should be contiguous i.e., a sub-array created by choosing the second and fourth element and skipping the third element is invalid.
