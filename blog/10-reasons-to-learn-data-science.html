                                Data has always been around. Man-kind has been recording data since it started to think.
                                Data science is the next big leap in the industry. The idea of data-driven business is
                                taking root deep in the mind of the business culture. If there was any time to get ahead
                                of the curve, this is it. Here are the top 10 reasons to learn data science and drive

                            <h2>Reason 1: High demand and impeccable growth</h2>

                            <p>
                                The number of jobs in Data Science has been increased by 28% by 2020. Data Science
                                related jobs have been proclaimed to be most sought after jobs today. It's not just the
                                craze and trends that make it an exciting profession but also high salary packages
                                attached to it. Businesses are looking for more and more data scientists to help them
                                adopt a data-driven approach.
                            </p>

                            <h2>
                                Reason 2: It’s all about Data and Big Data these days
                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                We have produced a lot of data. A study says that by now humans have produced around
                                140,000 Exabytes of data that is equivalent to the amount of character that can be
                                written on the papers made of all the trees from the amazon forest. Imagine this
                                analogy! That’s a huge amount. <br>

                                If you look around, you will find a computer first. Rather it is a desktop, Laptop, or
                                Mobile phone. And with this, we create an enormous amount of data every day. This data
                                in its oversimplified form is called Big Data. It can potentially lead to answers of
                                enigmatic questions that might produce huge productions. <br>

                                Thus, we need to analyze, filter and process these data. Data Science is the tool for
                                that.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Talking about technology, we are moving at an unimaginable speed. Automation, Smart
                                robots, Prediction systems, Recommendation systems, all these are products of AL and ML.
                                And trust me when I say this, It is the future! And all this is backed by huge data and
                                there comes data science into the picture again.

                            <p>
                                Once you become a data science analyst you have ample opportunities out there in various
                                companies. Here are a few job designations that you can grab such as - Data Scientist,
                                Analytics Specialists, Data Analyst, Big Data Engineer, etc. Thus big companies are
                                looking for people to take up these designations. Surely the competition is more, but
                                job opportunities and designations are even more.

                                To look at data and infer actionably results is the need of the hour. More than just a
                                need, it is a skill that will come handy in all walks of life. Surely it begins with
                                analyzing data, it eventually leads to data-driven thinking. And thus it becomes one of
                                the really important aspects of today’s world.

                                Reason 6: Priority Of Organisation
                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                Everything depends on data doesn’t matter if it’s multinational or small business. All
                                great minds use this data to formulate strategies for their organizations. Many
                                organizations have already started using data science for this. For example, Google uses
                                this data to render correct information for a search query in a fraction of seconds. If
                                no there wouldn’t have been data science, there won’t be a Google that we know today!
                            </p>

                            <h2>Reason 7: Core of Decision Making</h2>

                            <p>
                                With businesses adopting a more data-driven approach, the data science departments are
                                becoming crucial to their sustenance. Hence, as a data scientist working in a
                                data-driven business, you will always be at the core of decision making. Just imagine
                                being someone companies would look up to while making important decisions for the
                                organization. Sounds exciting right?

                            <p>
                                Just like the 90s that saw the rise of giants like Amazon and Google, data science will
                                eventually lead to its speculation phrase. Tech giants like Uber already have a
                                data-driven model in their operations. Like I have said before, there was ever a time to
                                get ahead of the curve, it is now! Thus, using data science companies are taking their
                                products to another level and leveling up their revenue streams.

                            <p>
                                There are a number of ways how you could use data science in your business. Manage your
                                data science project efficiently and see them add real value to your business. Data
                                science can help you in increasing the number of customers and serving them more

                                domain, data science is exceptional in this case. There is no compulsion that candidates
                                only from a computer science background can make a career in this field. It is open to
                                all and anyone can grab it easily. Surely having a computer science background is really
                                beneficial.
