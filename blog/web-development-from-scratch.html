                            <h2>Day 81- 120: Learn JS Front End Framework - React (Recommended)</h2>

                            <p>
                                Modern websites required front end skills such as React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc. I would recommend React since it’s very powerful, simple, and most trending. <br>
                                React is one of the most popular front end frameworks these days. React makes a simple website interactive without any backend support. Start with Basic of React such as React components, life-cycle, react routing, etc. As a web developer, React is an essential skill to have in the pocket. <br>
	                            Once basic is done and strong, move to the advanced React concepts to master React. Learn concepts such as Dynamic React, React statement management, Redux, React Hooks, etc. Mastering React ensures a strong web development career ahead.

                            <h2>Day 121- 135: Move to Database and Learn MongoDB</h2>

                            <p>
                                An application is incomplete with data and data in the application generally is stored and retrieved from the database. There are various databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL,  etc. But I would suggest MongoDB because it works well with the JS Stack and it is very easy for a beginner. <br>
	                            Start learning MongoDB basics such as basic CRUD operations, various filtering and manipulating operations, etc. Learn about the database integration with the front end and more.

                            </p>

                            <h2>Day 136- 160: Learn Node JS and Express</h2>

                            <p>
                                Finally, it’s time for Backend. And in 2020 Node is the best choice for it. Node is a JavaScript Backend runtime and express is a Node framework that ensures the efficiency of the web application. Learn about the various node concepts such as creating APIs and working with the REST, working and integrating with Mongo databases, etc. <br>
	                            Once you learn express and node, you will be able to create any kind of full-fledged web application. Thus, becoming a full stack web developer.

                            <h2>Day 161- 170: Learn about Deployment and create Projects</h2>

                            <p>
                                Final steps are to find resources and places where you can deploy projects such as Heroku, Docker, AWS, and more While developing is an essential skill, deploying is something that one should know. Also, create some front-end as well as full-stack projects in this period to enhance your skills and add projects to your portfolio. Working on and creating projects at every stage will help you gain confidence and polish your skills. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
