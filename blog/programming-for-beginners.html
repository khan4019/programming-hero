                                what should I do after learning programming? So, let’s break it down into different
                                parts.</p>
                            <h2>What is programming? </h2>

                            <p class="">Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to perform a
                                task.
                                Programming is the art of thinking clearly. There are many programming languages
                                available
                                like Javascript, PHP, Python, etc.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Why programming used for:</h2>

                            <p>Programming is used for many purposes, such as mobile apps, software, websites, games,
                                and
                                numerical calculations for research. And these programs work on computers, mobile or any
                                other machines.</p>

                            <p>Now we know what programming is and why it is used for, here are some tips that one can
                                follow:</p>

                            <h2>1. Know the purpose of learning programming:</h2>
                            <p>If you want to learn programming then you should know why you want to learn programming?
                                What
                                are the things you want to do with it? It's an important question to ask yourself. There
                                are
                                a lot of reasons to learn programming. So find your purpose.</p>

                            <h2>2. Choose the right language:</h2>
                            <p>There are many languages ​​in computer programming. Each of these languages ​​has some
                                unique
                                features and they are ideal for one-to-one work. For example, Java is used to create
                                mobile
                                apps, Javascript is used to create websites, HTML and CSS are used to design texts for
                                various web pages or browsers.</p>
                            <p>So we have to choose the programming language considering the work.</p>
                            <p>However, although the syntax used in different programming languages ​​is different,
                                their
                                basic concepts are the same. So those who want to start programming, they can choose a
                                high level of simple syntax language. As such, the syntax used in Python is relatively
                                simple and so it tops the list of beginner’s preferences.</p>
                            <p>Once you are done with the basics of programming, then any other language can be learned
                                easily.</p>

                            <h2>3. Find Tutorials, Blogs, Apps, etc:</h2>
                            <p>Some good tutorials or notes need to be gathered after choosing the target and
                                programming
                                language. Because a lot can be learned easily by following short and proper notes.
                                Nowadays
                                high-quality notes can be easily collected from various websites for free online.
                                Collecting
                                notes from any site, reading them, and practicing them can easily achieve the target.
                                You can find a lot of blogs where you can get ideas for programming. Nowadays people
                                use smartphones. There’s a lot of apps available related to programming like Programming
                                Hero and more.</p>

                            <h2>4. Start with small and simple programs:</h2>
                            <p>To learn programming we can write shortcodes and try it out. If we succeed in this, our
                                enthusiasm will increase. And by practicing short and simple codes over and over again,
                                we can gradually learn the programming language.</p>

                            <h2>5. Discuss programming:</h2>
                            <p>When learning programming you need to discuss programming with someone else. Because,
                                when we discuss something, we can better understand it and eliminate our misconceptions.
                                So, we can easily learn programming by practicing the subjects we are reading and
                                discussing with others.</p>


                            <h2>6. Trying to understand someone else's code:</h2>
                            <p>We can improve our programming skills by reading other people's code. A lot of example
                                codes are available online. We can learn how to use different logics and more efficient
                                code for the same problem. In this way, our knowledge of programming will continue to
                                grow and reach perfection.</p>

                            <h2>7. Understand the logic used during coding:</h2>
                            <p>We need to focus on the basics used when coding. Because the basics or logics used in
                                almost all programming languages ​​are the same. So if we master the basics of
                                programming well then we can easily learn any other language later. Moreover,
                                if you want to learn programming and do many things together, such as simulation,
                                building a website, or building software, then we have to learn different languages.</p>

                            <h2>8. Practice regularly:</h2>
                            <p>Regular practice is the most important part of learning programming. Only regular
                                practice can mix the ideas of programming with our blood. </p>

                            <h2>9. Solve new problems regularly:</h2>
                            <p>Solving new problems is the main goal of the programming journey. So, while coding,
                                try to solve small problems. By solving one problem after another we can increase
                                our ability to solve problems and our ability to think, which will later help us
                                to become better programmers.</p>

                            <h2>10. Reading programming books:</h2>
                            <p>Reading books is one of the most important things for programmers. Because we can
                                increase our knowledge by reading books. As a result, on the one hand, our skills
                                in programming will increase, and on the other hand, it will help you to be aware
                                of new ideas in the world of programming.
                            </p>
                            <h2>11. Online video lectures:</h2>
                            <p>Through online video lectures, one can easily know the opinions of experienced
                                teachers from different parts of the world on any subject. So, if we have
                                difficulty in understanding any programming subject, we can watch the video
                                lecture on YouTube. This will help us to learn programming faster. You can
                                also try online course platforms available, like Udemy, etc.
                            </p>

                            <p>When you learn something new, try to teach others about it. Then it will be
                                familiar to you. You will know your problem and be able to fix it. It will
                                help you to develop your confidence.
                            </p>
                            <h2>13. Concentrate patiently:</h2>
                            <p>Patience is an important skill programmers should have. Programmers suffer
                                by making mistakes in codes or not being able to catch mistakes in code.
                                So you can become a successful programmer only if you learn programming
                                with deep patience.
                            </p>

                            <p>While learning programming, you have to keep yourself updated with new
                                technologies. Because technologies are changing day by day. So you must
                                keep yourself updated with new technologies
                            </p>
                            <p>We can easily learn any programming language by adhering to the
                                above-mentioned points while learning programming.</p>
