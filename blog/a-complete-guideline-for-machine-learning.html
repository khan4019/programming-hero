                                machine learning in your day-to-day life. Let me give you some examples, Google spam
                                filter, Netflix recommendation system, Facebook face recognition, weather forecast, and
                                much more. All of these are Machine Learning. It has become one of the hottest
                                industries and has become like a trend for beginners. Want to make a career in ML? Here
                                is a complete guideline to master Machine Learning.

                            <h2>Step 1: Learn Python</h2>

                            <p>
                                Want to start with machine learning? There is no skipping Python! Yes, there are many
                                other languages that are used for ML but Python is one of the top choices. Python
                                provides a lot of libraries for various concepts such as data analysis, data
                                visualization, machine learning, and much more. Also, Python makes it easy for a
                                beginner to get comfortable in Python. Want to learn Python? Try out our application,<a
                                    href="https://www.programming-hero.com/"> Programming Hero</a> to learn python in a
                                fun way.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Step 2: Math is important</h2>

                            <p>
                                There are many controversies on this topic, whether you should know Math or not in order
                                to learn machine learning. The answer is, You don’t need to be a master in Math. But you
                                should know basic math so that you can understand the internal working of machine
                                learning algorithms. <br>
                                Learn math concepts like Linear algebra, Calculus, Statistics, and Probability. Machine
                                learning is all about data and data processing, thus these math concepts become very
                                important.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Step 3: Get Hands-On Data Science Libraries in Python</h2>

                            <p>
                                As I have been saying, It’s all about data. Thus, you will need some libraries to
                                process data, analyze data, and much more. Learn Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas,
                                Matpltlib, etc. Since these will be used a lot in your ML projects. Having a really good
                                knowledge of these libraries will be really beneficial.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Step 4: It’s Time for ML</h2>

                            <p>
                                After all the above concepts, it will be the correct time to start with Machine learning
                                algorithms. People out there say you can directly start writing some code in Python for
                                ML. But can we write a paragraph without learning alphabets and words? Of course not!
                                Thus I would suggest learning the theoretical and logical parts of the ML algorithms and
                                then moving towards the practical implementation.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Step 5: Get Hands-On ML Libraries in Python</h2>

                            <p>
                                Python is known for its libraries and it does the same work in the field of ML as well.
                                Python provides tons of libraries that can be used for machine learning like, scipy,
                                scikit-learn, and much more. With these, you can create your own machine learning models
                                and get good practical exposure.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Step 6: Create Projects</h2>

                            <p>
                                Rather it is any field, projects are something that you should do. Especially, ML is a
                                kind of field that unless you create projects and implement what you know, you won’t get
                                much confidence. Thus working on projects is something that will make your concepts much
                                clearer and enhance your skill sets. And after all, you will need something to show in
                                your portfolio as well. Right?

                            <p>
                                Image processing and Video processing are some of the important subfields of machine
                                learning. Python provides many libraries for this, but OpenCV is one of the most
                                powerful libraries for computer vision. It’s not just about learning it, but computer
                                vision is fun to learn and implement.

                            <h2>Step 8: A Step Ahead - Deep Learning</h2>

                            <p>
                                The next step from here is to start with Deep Learning which is a Machine Learning
                                subfield. Python provides libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc for deep learning that
                                you should surely try. TensorFlow is the core open-source library to help you develop
                                and train ML models. TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine
                                learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community
                                resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily
                                build and deploy ML-powered applications.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Machine learning is a big picture. And to master it, it takes time! It’s all about the
                                time and hard work you are ready to dedicate. What do you think? At which step are you
                                on? Let me know below in the comments.
