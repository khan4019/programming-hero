                                    Python is an object-oriented, general-purpose, high-level programming language. Over the past few years, the growth of Python has been incredible. Today, Python is one of the top programming languages of all time and has a quite good future ahead. Well, Python is used in many fields such as Machine learning, Data Science, the Internet of Things, and more, but today in this article we will discuss how we can use Python to create web applications. 
                                </p>

                                Python is amazing, and so is it for Web Development. Python provides a few amazing frameworks for web development that we will be discussing further in this article. Here, a few questions might come to your mind like, 
                            </p>

                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Well, if you are asking these questions, then you might want to stick till the end. So let’s start with any further delays. 
                            </p>

                            <h2>What is the framework?</h2>
                            <p>
                                A web framework is a code library that makes development faster and easier by providing common patterns for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.
                                In simple words, A web framework is just like a house that you want to buy! When you buy a house, you already have doors, windows, ceiling, bathrooms, etc in it. Right? Ever seen someone by just an empty space with these things? 😆 Later, you can customize your house however you need it. You might make up a whole new interior design, add furniture to it, and more stuff. That is exactly what a framework is, It's just like a ready house. You can use a framework with its existing features and make something of your own that is based on it just like a web application. 
                                While working on frameworks you don’t have to worry about the low-level implementations such as protocols, networking, concurrency, and more. 

                            </p>

                            <h2>Why use a framework?</h2>

                            <p>
                                Well, why not use a framework? Would you like to build a whole building from scratch to live? Of course not, you will rent or buy a house, right? Similarly, as a developer, rather than developing something from absolutely scratch, you would like to use something that will make your life easier. That’s what frameworks do for you! <br> 
                                Frameworks make the development process easier by giving a structure for development. They provide common patterns in a web application that are fast, reliable, and easily maintainable. It automates the implementation of common solutions which gives us the flexibility to focus on the application logic instead of the basic routine processes.

                            </p>

                            <h2>What does a web framework help in?</h2>

                            <p>
                                Well, frameworks are pretty useful! Below are some of the processes that frameworks help us in,  
                            </p>  
                            
                            <ul class="center">
                                <li> URL routing</li>
                                <li> Form handling and validation</li>
                                <li> Generating output using template engines </li>
                                <li> Communicate with Database and handle database interaction</li>
                                <li> Web application security</li>
                                <li> Web application CMS</li>
                                <li> Working with web sessions, cookies, and more.</li>
                                <li> Working and manipulating the front end</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Pretty awesome, right?</p>

                            <h2>Is Python a good choice for web development? </h2>

                            <p>
                                Ofcourse! Python is in high demand and one of the top technologies out there! Python provides various frameworks that are quite powerful and needed by the industry. 
                                Web development using Python is easy not only because of its amazing readability but also because the code doesn’t break when minor mistakes occur.
                                Also, we know Python takes 20% less code than any other programming language and gets things done quickly! So, if you are thinking of going for web development and you already know Python, then web frameworks with Python can surely be your choice.

                            <h2>Which are the top Python frameworks for web development?</h2>

                            <h2>1) Django</h2>

                                When it comes to web development using Django, then Django can be a top choice. 
                                Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Django is really beneficial for full-fledged heavyweight web applications.

                                <li> Ridiculously fast.</li>
                                <li> Reassuringly secure.</li>
                                <li> Exceedingly scalable.</li>
                                <li> Incredibly versatile.</li>
                            </ul>


                            <h2>2) Flask </h2>

                                When it comes to lightweight and less complex web applications development, Flask can be at your service. Flask is a lightweight web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Flask offers suggestions but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use.

                                Web2Py is an open-source, scalable, and a full-stack framework. As they say “The best way to understand web2py is to try it.” Web2py was inspired by Ruby on Rails and, as of Rails, it focuses on rapid development and follows a Model View Controller design. It is also inspired by Django and, as Django, it has the ability to generate forms from database tables and it includes an extensive set of validators.

                                CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web framework. CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This results in smaller source code developed in less time. CherryPy is now more than ten years old and it has proven to be very fast and stable.
